My Hobowars cheat. Basically I got obsessed with Hobowars and decided to make a program that would level me up without me having to be at the computer. You go to the hobowars URL for training a particular skill and just start the program. It basically just auto clicks and refreshes the page. I was going to modify it to go through the different URLs but figured it was useless. This is for facebook Hobowars. I lost the VB project just got the code in Code.txt
